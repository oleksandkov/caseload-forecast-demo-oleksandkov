### 6-report

Grapher, compose ./analysis/report-1/ report that would provide a reporting layer to the  lane 6 report as described in the method.md. Make sure the report references fore_manifest and model_registry and has a thorough knowledge of lane 3-mint, 4-train, and 5-forecast. Use eda-2 as a stylistic manuals (but also chekc /eda-1/eda-style-guide.md for more context if needed). Compose .R and .qmd that generate a hmtl document that reports on estimated models and is structured as inverted pyramid. The reader of the document must walk away with understanding what forecasting models exist (in this case only two, but we will be adding as we go further), how their forecast differs, and what uncovered evidence could be helpful in articulating a strategy for predicting the future with implication the policy.  

### test-ellis-cache

The script ./manipulation/2-test-ellis-cache.R should be renamed into ./manipulation/nonflow/test-ellis-cache.R, because while it has a distinct spot in the pipeline sequence (between lanes 2 and 3), it works as a support script (providing deterministic language to the agentic implementation of the testing). Rename and ensure that other places where it is referenced in the codebase are adjusted accordingling. (e.g. tasks, scripts, docs)

### 5-forecast

Data Engineer, compose 5-forecast-IS.R script that would implement lane 5 and create forecasting artefacts, according the method.md. Focus on the first two model teir only. Study commit 8a11f22220ca4dc63b624d5db24b34a87a726841 to inform your model hand-off. Anticipate the needs of the  lane 6 Report to create various reproducible documents from results of the mint-train-forecast processes.  Create a brief entry into memory-ai and a detailed account into the memory/log/. These documens should be useful to agents who will consume the products of the  lane 5 forecast.  

### 4-train  

Data Engineer, compose 4-train-IS.R script that would implement lane 4 and train models according to the method.md. Focus on the first two models only, to keep things simple. Consider how 5-model-IS.R will be consuming the project of the 4-train process and inform your design decision about model hand-off on this.  

## 2026-02-20

Data engineer, compose 3-mint-a.R that would output data of class "A" that support

### Create EDA-2

Follow the example of eda-1 and compose ./analysis/eda-2/ that would introduce the reader to the data (focus on total caseload and client type tables only, ignore other tables to keep it simple for now). Focus on timeseries for visuals, but use other graphs when necessary.  

### Create Ellis

Data Engineer, please compose ./manipulation/2-ellis.R that would input ./data-private/derived/open-data-is-1.sqlite that would create a set of tidy data tables to be written into ./data-private/derived/open-data-is-2.sqlite (a relational database that would be used as a starting point for subsequent analytic efforts). Follow the example of ./manipulation/example/ellis-lane-example.R. Make sure you verify each data type (see RAnalysisSkeleton). First, conduct a thorough exploration of the raw table and confirm your understanding of it with the human user. Wait for the confirmation of the list of table you will propose before creating it.  

### Create Ferry

Let's create `./manipulation/1-ferry.R` lane following the `./manipulation/ferry-lane-example.R` that would demonstrate the import from four (4) sources: 1) [URL](https://open.alberta.ca/dataset/e1ec585f-3f52-40f2-a022-5a38ea3397e5/resource/4f97a3ae-1b3a-48e9-a96f-f65c58526e07/download/is-aggregated-data-april-2005-sep-2025.csv) 2) CSV (data-public\raw\is-aggregated-data-april-2005-sep-2025.csv), 3) SQLite (data-public\raw\open-data-is-sep-2025.sqlite) and 4) SQL Server [RESEARCH_PROJECT_CACHE_UAT].[AMLdemo].[open_data_is_sep_2025]]). The product of the ferry should be a `./data-private/derived/open-data-is-1.sqlite` file that would contain the raw content of the input.  
The ferry lane will not do any transformations. Before writing data to db, it must demonstrate that the inputs from all four sources are identical and can be used interchangably.

## 2026-02-12

We need to design the ferry lane that would implement the import from four different sources: csv, url, sqlite and sql server. Before we compose this ferry script, let's create the sqlite and sqrver sources. Create an R script (`./manipulation/create-data-assets.R`) that would create 1) a sqlite db in `data-public/raw/` with identical contents as our csv data source and 2) table `AMLdemo`.open_data_is_sep_2025 on research_project_cache via ODBC, like you see in the example of ferry.
