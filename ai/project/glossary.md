## Data Pipeline Terminology

### Pattern
A reusable solution template for common data pipeline tasks. Patterns define the structure, philosophy, and constraints for a category of operations. The project uses six patterns: Ferry, Ellis, Mint, Train, Forecast, Report.

### Lane
A specific implementation instance of a pattern within a project. A lane may be implemented as a single script or a group of scripts operating within the same pattern. Lanes are numbered to indicate approximate execution order across the full pipeline. Examples: `1-ferry.R`, `2-ellis.R`, `3-mint-IS.R`, `4-train-arima.R`, `5-forecast-IS.R`, `6-report-IS.qmd`.

### Ferry Pattern
Data transport pattern that moves data between storage locations with minimal/zero semantic transformation. Like a "cargo ship" - carries data intact. 
- **Allowed**: SQL filtering, SQL aggregation, column selection
- **Forbidden**: Column renaming, factor recoding, business logic
- **Input**: External databases, APIs, flat files
- **Output**: CACHE database (staging schema), parquet backup

### Ellis Pattern
Data transformation pattern that creates clean, analysis-ready datasets. Named after Ellis Island - the immigration processing center where arrivals are inspected, documented, and standardized before entry.
- **Required**: Name standardization, factor recoding, data type verification, missing data handling, derived variables
- **Includes**: Minimal EDA for validation (not extensive exploration)
- **Input**: CACHE staging (ferry output), flat files, parquet
- **Output**: CACHE database (project schema), WAREHOUSE archive, parquet files
- **Documentation**: Generates CACHE-manifest.md

### Mint Pattern
Model-ready data preparation pattern that shapes Ellis output into standardized artifacts consumed by Train lanes. Named for coin minting — producing a standardized artifact of exact specification from refined material.
- **Applies**: Train/test split (keyed to `focal_date`), log transforms, xreg matrix construction, temporal subsetting
- **Codifies**: EDA-confirmed analytical decisions (e.g., log transform, seasonal period, differencing order)
- **Forbidden**: Model fitting, new data sourcing, re-running Ellis logic
- **Input**: Ellis parquet output + EDA-informed decisions
- **Output**: Apache Parquet data artifacts in `./data-private/derived/forge/` + `forge_manifest.yml`
  - `ds_train/test/full.parquet` — data frame slices; Train lane reconstructs `ts` objects from `$y` column
  - `xreg_train/test/full/future.parquet` — exogenous regressors with `date` column for cross-language use
  - `xreg_dynamic_*.parquet` — 0-row schema placeholder for Tier 4
- **Note**: `ts` objects are built in-memory during Mint for validation but **not persisted** (parquet is the on-disk format)
- **Documentation**: Generates forge_manifest.yml

### Train Pattern
Model estimation pattern that fits statistical models and evaluates diagnostic quality. Each Train lane consumes Mint artifacts only — never Ellis output directly.
- **Process**: Estimate model parameters on training slice, evaluate fit diagnostics, backtest on held-out window
- **Input**: Mint artifacts (`ds_*.parquet`, `xreg_*.parquet`, `forge_manifest.yml`); reconstruct `ts` objects on load
- **Output**: Fitted model `.rds` in `./data-private/derived/models/` + model registry entry (R model objects cannot be stored as parquet)
- **Versioning**: Each model links to its `forge_manifest.yml` via `forge_hash` in the model registry

### Forecast Pattern
Prediction generation pattern that produces forward-looking forecasts from Train model objects.
- **Process**: Apply fitted model to full series, generate point forecasts + prediction intervals for configured horizon
- **Input**: Train model `.rds` + Mint `ds_full.parquet` for forward projection (reconstruct `ts_full` on load)
- **Output**: CSV of point forecasts + intervals, Quarto report
- **Horizon**: Configured in `config.yml` (default: 24 months from `focal_date`)

### Report Pattern
Final deliverable assembly pattern that combines EDA, model performance, and forecasts into publication-ready output.
- **Input**: EDA reports, Train performance metrics, Forecast outputs
- **Output**: Static HTML report for stakeholder delivery
- **Delivery**: SharePoint/network drive (Phase 1); Azure Static Web App + AAD auth (Phase 2)

### EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)
Exploratory analysis that operates on Ellis output. EDA is **not a numbered lane** in the pipeline — it is a lateral analytical activity that produces reports and insight, not data artifacts consumed by downstream scripts. EDA findings are codified as documented decisions in Mint scripts (e.g., `[EDA-001] Log transform: TRUE`).

## Mint-Train-Forecast Lineage

The Mint, Train, and Forecast patterns form a versioned chain where each stage's output is traceable to its input. All three stages are keyed by `focal_date`. Changing `focal_date` invalidates all Mint, Train, and Forecast artifacts. The `forge_manifest.yml` provides the hash that links a model registry entry back to its exact input data slice.

```
Ellis output → [EDA insight] → Mint → Train → Forecast
                                 │       │        │
                           forge_manifest │   forecast CSV
                                 │    model .rds   │   (data artifacts: .parquet)
                                 └── forge_hash ────┘
                                   (versioning bond)
```

### Forge Manifest
YAML file (`forge_manifest.yml`) documenting the data contract between Mint and Train: `focal_date`, split date, transform decisions (log, seasonal period), row counts, and EDA decision references. Analogous to CACHE-manifest for Ellis, but for model-ready artifacts.

---

## Storage Layers

### CACHE
Intermediate database storage - the last stop before analysis. Contains multiple schemas:
- **Staging schema** (`{project}_staging` or `_TEST`): Ferry deposits raw data here
- **Project schema** (`P{YYYYMMDD}`): Ellis writes analysis-ready data here
- Both Ferry and Ellis write to CACHE, but to different schemas with different purposes.

### WAREHOUSE
Long-term archival database storage. Only Ellis writes here after data pipelines are stabilized and verified. Used for reproducibility and historical preservation.

---

## Schema Naming Conventions

### `_TEST`
Reserved for pattern demonstrations and ad-hoc testing. Not for production project data.

### `P{YYYYMMDD}`
Project schema naming convention. Date represents project launch or data snapshot date.
Example: `P20250120` for a project launched January 20, 2025.

### `P{YYYYMMDD}_staging`
Optional staging schema within a project namespace for Ferry outputs before Ellis processing.

---

## General Terms

### Artifact
Any generated output (report, model, dataset) subject to version control.

### Seed
Fixed value used to initialize pseudo-random processes for reproducibility.

### Persona
A role-specific instruction set shaping AI assistant behavior.

### Memory Entry
A logged observation or decision stored in project memory files.

### CACHE-manifest
Documentation file (`./data-public/metadata/CACHE-manifest.md`) describing analysis-ready datasets produced by Ellis pattern. Includes data structure, transformations applied, factor taxonomies, and usage notes.

### INPUT-manifest
Documentation file (`./data-public/metadata/INPUT-manifest.md`) describing raw input data before Ferry/Ellis processing.

### Forge Manifest
YAML file (`./data-private/derived/forge/forge_manifest.yml`) documenting model-ready data slices produced by Mint pattern. Includes `focal_date`, split boundaries, transform decisions, row counts, and EDA decision log.

---

## Forecasting Terminology

### Forecast Horizon
The number of time steps ahead for which predictions are generated. This project uses a **24-month horizon** (2 years forward from `focal_date`).

### Focal Date
The reference date representing the "present" for analysis purposes. Typically the last month with observed data. Configured in `config.yml` as `focal_date`.

### Train/Test Split
Division of historical data into:
- **Training set**: Used to estimate model parameters (all data up to `focal_date - 24 months`)
- **Test set**: Held-out data for backtesting model performance (last 24 months before `focal_date`)

### Backtesting
Retrospective evaluation of forecast accuracy by pretending past data points are "future" and comparing predictions to actuals.

### Model Tier
Classification of forecasting models by complexity:
1. **Naive baseline**: Simple benchmark (last value carried forward)
2. **ARIMA**: Autoregressive integrated moving average (univariate time series model)
3. **ARIMA + static predictor**: Includes time-invariant exogenous variable (e.g., client type)
4. **ARIMA + time-varying predictor**: Includes dynamic covariate (e.g., economic indicator)

### Prediction Interval
Range around point forecast representing uncertainty. Commonly 80% and 95% intervals (wider = more conservative).

### Point Forecast
Single "best guess" predicted value (typically the mean or median of the forecast distribution).

### Stationarity
A time series property where statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) are constant over time. ARIMA models require stationarity, often achieved via differencing.

### Seasonality
Regular, predictable patterns that repeat over fixed periods (e.g., monthly cycles, fiscal year effects).
